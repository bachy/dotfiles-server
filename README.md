## Goal

Create general dotfiles that can be installed on production and staging servers. 
These files will replace any personal dotfiles to prevent unexpected behavior.

## Requirements

- Can not override standard server commands
- Must have a help command
- Must show if we are on staging, test or production
- Must show the current branch we are on, in case of a git repo
